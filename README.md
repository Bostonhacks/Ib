# Artefatto
## Description
This is the new museum site for BostonHacks, the old museum site can be found [here](https://github.com/Bostonhacks/museo). Since the old museum is currently hosted on GitHub pages, this new repo is in place to avoid any unwanted downtime.

## Running it Locally
Make sure you have [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) installed. Note that the version of `bundler` is 2.0.1. If you have another version of `bundler`, run
`gem install bundler -v 2.0.1`

Run `bundle install` to install dependencies from Gemfile.lock.

In order to start server, run the command `bundle exec jekyll serve`.
